What are Regular Expressions?

A regular expression can be defined as a strings that represent several sequence of characters. One of the most important things about regular expressions is that they allow you to filter the output of a command or file, edit a section of a text or configuration file and so on.
Features of Regular Expression

Regular expressions are made of:

    Ordinary characters such as space, underscore(_), A-Z, a-z, 0-9.
    Meta characters that are expanded to ordinary characters, they include:
        (.) it matches any single character except a newline.
        (*) it matches zero or more existences of the immediate character preceding it.
        [ character(s) ] it matches any one of the characters specified in character(s), one can also use a hyphen (-) to mean a range of characters such as [a-f], [1-5], and so on.
        ^ it matches the beginning of a line in a file.
        $ matches the end of line in a file.
        \ it is an escape character.

Specifying Characters in a Range

Understand characters with awk:

    [0-9] means a single number
    [a-z] means match a single lower case letter
    [A-Z] means match a single upper case letter
    [a-zA-Z] means match a single letter
    [a-zA-Z 0-9] means match a single letter or number
